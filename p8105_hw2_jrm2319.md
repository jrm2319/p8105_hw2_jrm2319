    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
nyc_subway = read.csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
